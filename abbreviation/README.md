# Abbreviation

## Challenge #2

**Challenge description**

Create a program that takes a sentence as an input and abbreviates it by leaving the first and last character of each 
word but replacing the middle characters with the total number of characters in said word. Words that are two characters or less remain the same. Non-alphabetic characters such as a space also remain the same.
 
This is a sentence = T2s is a s6e
 
**Extra challenge**
 
Create an additional function that does the same as the above but instead of outputting the total middle characters in each word, jumble the middle characters of each word instead.
 
This is a sentence = Tihs is a setnecne
