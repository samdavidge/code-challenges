# Closest Numbers

## **Challenge #3**

**Challenge description**

Given a list of unsorted integers can you find the pair of elements that have the smallest absolute difference between them? If there are multiple pairs, find them all.

**Input Format**

You must provide an integer which will be used to generate an array of random integers. For example, if you provide 10 then you will generate an array of 10 random integers.

**Output Format**

Output the pairs of elements with the smallest difference. If there are multiple pairs, output them all. If there's a number which lies in two pairs, print it two times.

**For example**

Array = [1, 3, 5]

Output = 1 and 3 (diff 2), 3 and 5 (diff 2)

Array = [1, 7, 9]

Output = 7 and 9 (diff 2)

**Extra challenge**

Time the execution of the program and we can see which language/implementation is quickest against and array of n size.

No sorting the array!

Time spent: 2.5 hours
