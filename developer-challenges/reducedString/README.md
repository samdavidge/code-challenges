# Reduced String

## Challenge #4

**Challenge description**

Paul has a string consisting of x lowercase English alphabetic letters. In one operation, he can delete any pair of adjacent letters with same value. For example, string "aabcc" would become either "aab" or "bcc" after 1 operation.

Paul wants to reduce his string as much as possible. To do this, he will repeat the above operation as many times as it can be performed. Help Steve out by finding and printing his string's non-reducible form!

Note: If the final string is empty, print Empty String.

Time spent: 20 minutes
