# Airport Rotator

This week’s challenge will be based in the terminal… We’ve all seen those ticker flap displays in airports. So the challenge is to create one!

## How it works

You notice that each flap character is on some kind of a rotor and the order of characters on each rotor is:

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ?!@#&()|<>.:=-+*/0123456789

You deduce that the display works like this:

Starting from the left, all rotors (from the current one to the end of the line) flap, and stop when their respective letter is showing.

You can choose how your board updates, and what destinations to show. (e.g. LOS ANGELES -> KUALA LUMPUR -> BIRMINGHAM)
