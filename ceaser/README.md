# Ceaser Encryption

## Challenge #1

**Challenge description**

Write a program to perform a basic ‘Ceaser’ encryption and decryption on text.
This algorithm works by moving letters along by an ‘offset’. If the offset is 2 then b —> d, h—>j etc.
Try to write two functions — one called ‘encrypt’ and one called ’decrypt’.
Both will**** return a string.
The user selects whether the wish to encrypt or decrypt.
The user enters sentence to encrypt and the encryption key (i.e. how many we move the letters along — this is a smallish integer).
The program responds with the encrypted or decrypted version.

Time spent: 2 hours
